Generate Terraform code for provisioning a <architecture-explanation> in <cloud-provider> cloud. The architecture involves:
- <List key components and services needed for the architecture>.
- The setup should follow best practices for security, scalability, and maintainability.
- Implement the principle of least privilege for IAM roles and permissions.
- Use variables for customizable configuration options.
- Organize the code into separate `.tf` files for improved modularity and readability.
- Document each resource and module for future reference.
- Ensure the architecture has strategy for backup and Disaster Recovery.
- Enable proper monitoring and logging for the infrastructure.

Please provide the Terraform code that accomplishes the above requirements, including appropriate resource names, variable definitions, and module organization. 

[Optionally, include any additional specifications or preferences you have for the architecture or code generation process.]
